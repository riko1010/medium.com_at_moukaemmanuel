The lawyer is related to the accusers, Michael may have deliberately brought a lawyer related to the accusers to ensure I was viable for criminal accusation evident by the lawyer and police listening to my accounts and falsifying a statement with false information. Michael obstructed justice and prevented the report of a crime by preventing evidence and witnesses of attacks before and after my arrest from being brought to Asaba police command by my nephew, Tino. Michael writes, speaks and behaves strangely lately.

He is a religious leader with the church, Celestial Church of Christ(CCC). CCC is a spiritual church that operates similar to fetish or juju. The difference is insistence that it’s practices must be godly and avoidance of colors such as black and red to indicate it is not affiliated with fetish or juju practices.</p><blockquote name="c8d4" id="c8d4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Michael brought a lawyer, Barr.Kalikwu, a relative of the person claimed to be dead during the April 19, 2022 attack at my gated premises without my asking, to Asaba police command on April 21, 2022.</blockquote><p name="1d23" id="1d23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I was transferred to Asaba police command from Agbor police command on April 20, 2022. The lawyer Barr.Kalikwu listened to my account and collaborated with police to falsify a statement claiming an accidental discharge occurred without my consent. Police officer blessing wrote the statement herself, she did not write the detailed account of events stating that I am a licensed hunter and faced multiple robberies and assassination attempts which were reported to the police. Michael is aware of my account of events from Agbor police command to Asaba police command. He claims he went to the hospital at Agbor and initially informed me that the intruder at my property, Happy Uboh(claimed to be dead), was being taken to a traditional doctor(local doctors that treat with roots and herbs). He later claimed that Happy Uboh was sent to FMC(Federal medical centre) Asaba, a hospital. I successfully argued that I did not commit a crime but Barr.Kalikwu who happens to be related to the persons accusing me falsified a statement to allow police charge me with a capital crime of murder. It would have been impossible to charge me with a crime if the police investigated and receive my witness accounts. The negative actions of Michael gives reason to suspect Michael intentionally brought Barr.Kalikwu, a relative of the persons claimed to be dead, Happy Uboh, to sabotage and imprison me with falsification of an accidental discharge when there is no evidence to show anyone was shot during the attack at my premises.</p><h3 name="2834" id="2834" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Refusal to inform the accusers of the facts.</h3><p name="572c" id="572c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Michael refused to inform the accusers of the facts when he engaged them during the 35+ days of spent at Asaba police command.</p><blockquote name="9dc5" id="9dc5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Michael insisted that he cannot inform them I was innocent because the only thing he was required to do was beg the accusers.</blockquote><p name="a424" id="a424" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I argued against this logic as it was important to inform anyone accusing me of a crime that I did not commit a crime. Why would I beg without informing the accusers of my innocence?. I refused to provide further monies for resolution of the matter until Barr.Aliu (my lawyer) mediated and brought peace between me and Michael at Asaba police command. Michael agreed he would follow the plan to inform the accusers of the facts while I was making efforts to ensure police admits the facts that I was a robbery and assassination attempts compared to an accidental discharge as falsified by Barr.Kalikwu and police.</p><h3 name="712c" id="712c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Complaint to Michael about robberies and repeat attacks</h3><p name="db00" id="db00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I complained to Michael about the robberies and repeat attacks before April 19, 2022, his response was that I cannot fight a community or a group of armed robbers. I argued that one man who is right can fight a group of wrongdoers.</p><h3 name="812b" id="812b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Michael’s misappropriation of funds</h3><p name="1083" id="1083" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Michael stated that Barr.Kalikwu would charge ₦300,000 for his service, I gave a detailed account which he refused to accept referring to falsify a statement with police. I added a gift of ₦100,000 totalling ₦400,000 for his engagement of the matter as a lawyer.</p><figure name="6298" id="6298" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*vDVzQ2Ue7gfKI2GPBNehrw.jpeg" data-width="720" data-height="1169" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vDVzQ2Ue7gfKI2GPBNehrw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">₦1 million sent to Michael on April 21, 2022</figcaption></figure><p name="ddf8" id="ddf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I sent ₦1 million to Michael on April 21, 2022. The balance amount of ₦600,000 was for other activities towards my release from Asaba police custody. Michael misappropriated the ₦600,000 and other monies without a result or response. He feigns ignorance when I enquire about monies i allocated for my defense and release. I requested that he engage the accusers with the facts of what occurred, he elected to engage chiefs and other persons, spend money without accountability while refusing to inform these persons that I was innocent as I stated, unaware of the accusation, and a victim of the attack on April 19, 2022, at my gated premises.</p><h3 name="25b9" id="25b9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Refusal to give money to Michael for these reasons:</h3><p name="cdce" id="cdce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Michael is trying to imprison me from his actions and utterances. He has a habit of pretending he forgot what he stated earlier. Michael is not that old. He asks for money while visibly sabotaging my efforts. He has tried to blackmail me into granting his requests. I refuse to sponsor someone hellbent on imprisoning me.</p><h4 name="1f64" id="1f64" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Consulting a lawyer related to the person claimed to be dead and his falsification of a statement</h4><p name="341f" id="341f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I refused to give Michael money after his wrong action of consulting a lawyer that was related to the person claimed to be dead, Happy Uboh, to represent me at the police station. The lawyer has a conflict of interest and falsified a statement to prove this claim true. Michael is a witness of the falsification of a statement by Barr.Kalikwu and Police. I forgave and resumed normal relations.</p><h4 name="ca70" id="ca70" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Obstruction of justice and failure to report a crime</h4><p name="0d18" id="0d18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Again, I refused to give Michael money after he obstructed justice, failed to report a crime and prevented the report of a crime. My property was attacked while in custody at Asaba police command.</p><figure name="fdb9" id="fdb9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*vswcurmL-dh_zX6wCi6cwQ.jpeg" data-width="1224" data-height="1584" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vswcurmL-dh_zX6wCi6cwQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Assassination attempts and malicious damage of my property by attackers while in police custody at Asaba. Proof of the life threatening attacks police refused to admit and investigate.</figcaption></figure><p name="89df" id="89df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I asked my nephew, Tino, to take photos of the attack and bring the evidence alongside two witnesses, Emmanuel, a welder, and Okafor, to Asaba police command. Michael obstructed the report of the crime to Asaba police command by preventing Tino from coming to Asaba with the evidence and witnesses to the armed attacks before April 19, 2022, and attacks while I was detained at Asaba police command. Michael attempted to imprison me by obstructing justice. He claims to be protecting the people that attacked me because they were persons from the community.</p><blockquote name="1ef4" id="1ef4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’ve asked Michael if I should be accused of murder when I’m innocent and the actual attackers allowed to accuse me and roam freely while I’m detained.</blockquote><p name="21cd" id="21cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Happy Uboh(claimed to be dead) was not granted entry into my premises lawfully.</p><h4 name="2e41" id="2e41" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Refusal to compel police officer Duke Amerika to report the incidents I reported to him, to the Asaba police command</h4><p name="fee4" id="fee4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Michael asked for money for his eye treatment which I gave, however I stopped giving him money once again due to his refusal to resolve the challenge he created at Asaba when he obstructed justice. I asked him to inform the police that he was aware of the attack at my premises while I was in custody at Asaba police command, and that he should ask police officer Duke Amerika who responded to my complaint on February 12, 2022, to visit Asaba police command for presentation of his report on the incident for which I invited him to the premises. It is wrong to charge me for murder when I reported such incidents to the police, I asked Duke to engage Asaba police command to drop the wrong and ridiculous charge of murder. Duke has not done that as at July 11, 2022.</p><figure name="b33b" id="b33b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DSxUZ797nUylSaHwylqTsA.jpeg" data-width="720" data-height="1147" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DSxUZ797nUylSaHwylqTsA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Police officer Duke Amerika who I invited on February 12, 2022, about robbery and assassination at my premises.</figcaption></figure><p name="0226" id="0226" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I gave Michael ₦100,000 for this effort and he informed me that he and police officer Duke recommend I engage a medical doctor rather than prove my innocence so I get freedom through complex means than proving I’m innocent.</p><figure name="eb93" id="eb93" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JHIiHmc_UMrUKHz1x2ZSDA.jpeg" data-width="720" data-height="1446" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JHIiHmc_UMrUKHz1x2ZSDA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Chats with my supposed father, Michael, <a href="https://wchat.space/Michael_Morka" data-href="https://wchat.space/Michael_Morka" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://wchat.space/Michael_Morka</a><a href="https://wchat.space/Michael_Morka" data-href="https://wchat.space/Michael_Morka" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></figcaption></figure><p name="8a3a" id="8a3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Michael is trying to get me to engage a psychiatrist to certify me as mentally ill as part of his plan to imprison me and destroy my life.

He made other disturbing comments, derogatory and provoking. I completed compilation of my statement and evidence around November 2022. I presented these facts to Michael and other persons who were convinced they had succeeded in imprisoning me for life. They stopped the derogatory comments when it became evident I would not be imprisoned for life.</p><h4 name="3bfd" id="3bfd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Michael’s efforts to prevent publicity of wrongdoers</h4><p name="6851" id="6851" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">Michael complains that my publicity efforts should be curtailed, he asked the prison authorities to prevent me from publicising these issues through seizure of the means I use in exposing his wrongdoing and that of other persons. I argued with the prison authorities that the welfare service allows inmates to call and engage others lawfully, neither the prison authorities nor Michael has a right to prevent me from communicating and publicising the wrongdoing of Michael, police, lawyers and other wrongdoers.</p></div></div></section><section name="065a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b6e0" id="b6e0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">References &amp; Media</p><ul class="postList"><li name="07dc" id="07dc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><a href="https://wchat.space/MichaelMorka-ChiefMichael2" data-href="https://wchat.space/MichaelMorka-ChiefMichael2" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wchat WhatsApp Conversations with Michael</a></li><li name="fcd7" id="fcd7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing"><a href="https://wchat.space/MichaelMorka-23470614633891" data-href="https://wchat.space/MichaelMorka-23470614633891" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wchat WhatsApp Conversations with Michael 2</a></li></ul></div></div></section>
