Barr.Osifo recommended by Lex Divina law firm Asaba represented me. The controversial lawyer, Barr.Goodluck Kalikwu presented himself late. I earlier asked Barr.Kalikwu to disengage from the matter at Asaba police command when he orchestrated the false statement and contrary to his justification for presenting a false statement alongside the police did not act on my bail. He claimed he and the police were creating a “bailable” statement against my consent. Barr.Aliu, my lawyer, arrived from Lagos and was informed to take over the issue and resolve any wrongdoing by Barr.Kalikwu.</p><p name="4ade" id="4ade" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Barr.Kalikwu continued to act negatively, I engaged Sani Katu SAN of Mamman Nasir &amp; Co. Law firm in Kaduna and Abuja. They were to represent me at court and took an 8 page statement while I was held at Agbor prison but did not represent me at court as paid for.</p><p name="a10c" id="a10c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I appeared before Umunede court in Leg chains against my protest of which the prison later switched to hand cuffs. I already questioned Barr.Kalikwu as to why he would wish to falsify a statement and connive with the prison Doctor, named Dr.Elliot whom I later met and informed that I had no arrangement regarding an evaluation with Barr.Kalikwu but paid 300,000 Naira to have him, Dr.Elliot approve my personal doctors attending to me for the assault by armed men I suffered at my premises. Barr.Kalikwu may have paid Dr.Elliot 25,000 Naira and is yet to refund my money paid for services he did not render. Barr.Kalikwu informed me that Dr.Elliot would not issue a medical report as I refused to provide my name in the absence of my Lawyer and refused to receive medical attention from anyone but my personal doctors. I presented copies of the facts when compiled to Dr.Elliot as he outrightly asked me if I killed someone which I immediately refuted. I was surprised as to how a doctor would be informed of the accusation against me when I requested he provide authorisation for my personal doctors to attend to me. He continues to visit the prison but I’m yet to know the actions he’s undertaken. I’ll review the case file soon enough. It would be unfortunate if Barr.Kalikwu tried to present me as mentally ill after falsifying a statement and acting contrary to the medical arrangement.</p><blockquote name="be73" id="be73" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The Judge, Justice Dafe, complained about my outfit. I was dressed in long sleeves and trousers from TM Lewin or Charles Tyrwhitt, a suit and cuff links. I wore a face mask and speak English with proficiency. What was bad about my outfit ?. I looked like a lawyer but that’s how every businessman dresses. I run a company in Agbor, how else would I dress when that’s how I dress everyday.</blockquote><p name="71a7" id="71a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Justice Dafe may not like me, I’m not sure why but I’d guess none of the Judges are used to confident persons. Most persons they meet may be repentant, remorseful or scared. I’m confident, energetic and complaining about human rights abuses. I do not mean to be rude but I have no choice but to make my voice heard in my complaint that Police falsified a statement, took money for bail, tortured and sexually abused me and other complaints. I cannot stand in a dock(which I find uncomfortable compared to sitting) happily or calmly while I had been detained for over 5 months when I first met Justice Dafe. I was angry. I did bow so I recognised her authority over her court. The state counsel lectured me on not addressing Justice Dafe as “Your honor”, insisting I address her as “my lord”. So, My Lord, Justice Dafe, may not like me. I hope she sees that I’m a victim and deserving of assistance. I’m respected and loved by everyone, I don’t treat people how I’ve been treated during this absurd accusation so I find the actions of negative persons wrong and criminal.</p><p name="c516" id="c516" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Pride, prestige, respect, I know what these are but I’ve found that in Delta state, people interprete these things differently. The criteria for what can be considered respectful is truth. I say the truth and I expect persons affected to never feel disrespected. How can the truth ever be an insult ?. This concern is reflected in how lots of persons claim I insult them while I’m saying and doing what is truthful and what is right ?. I can’t yield to oppression or suffer inconvenience to please others. I can sacrifice a lot to help others but I’d not let myself be abused or oppressed.</p></div></div></section><section name="f3a8" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d61b" id="d61b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I don’t know why Justice Dafe did not grant bail on multiple occasions. When the time I’d spent detained spanned a year, I have sought to inform her that the recommendation for bail in ACJA, Section 161, states that she can grant bail under exceptional circumstances such as (2)(a) ill health… (b) extraordinary delay…exceeding one year. © at her discretion. My situation fulfils all criteria. I was assaulted with an object suspected to be a gun during one of these attacks prior to the April 19, 2022, attack where I’m being wrongly accused of murder. I am yet to receive medical care which can best be provided by my doctors. The equipments needed for tests and treatment of such an assault at not available within the prison or general hospitals. I made reservation at a qualified medical institution, Synapse Services, on 30th June, 2022. I am expected to receive assessment, tests and treatment.</p><figure name="da7d" id="da7d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Wdr039qTyWOrfhgRwdBphA.jpeg" data-width="649" data-height="470" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wdr039qTyWOrfhgRwdBphA.jpeg"></figure><p name="1159" id="1159" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The prosecution, Barr.F.O. Isichie, called 1 witness of 3, on , the witness stated he is not a witness and claims to know me. Barr.Ehiedu representing me stated “I win” after interviewing the witness and confirming the accusation was hear say. It has been 1 year and 1 month since May 25, 2022 when I was arraigned. The delay is extraordinary in nature and gives reason for the court to grant bail alongside the exceptional circumstance of ill health. In addition to the authority of Justice Dafe to grant bail at her discretion, these conditions supplement my request that the court grant bail and review my arguments being presented as a motion to stop the trial if it is still ongoing in the absence of witnesses or evidence. I have asked both Justice Dafe and the Chief Judge, Delta State, Justice Diai, to kindly grant bail while I present my motions and arguments contesting the case file and the falsification by the Police.</p><p name="9eb6" id="9eb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sought the assistance of the court clerks at Umunede High Court during an appearance as I was unrepresented and refused to give a plea until I got Barr.Seyi to represent me whom I eventually relieved due to engagement of a Barr.F.F who refused to give the meaning of the initials, I suspect it may be Femi Falana SAN but there is no information to indicate that. Ironically, I recently sought to contact and engage Femi Falana SAN. A court clerk named Samuel was kind enough to listen to my complaints about falsification of a statement, engaging Sani Katu SAN and being unrepresented and the casefile being falsified. I presented the facts for him to admit to the court and present to the Judge, Justice Dafe, for her review and discharge of the case before the court on grounds of being falsified. The Registrar, Samuel, introduced a lawyer Barr.Ehiedu who received further copies of the documents and instructions to admit it as evidence to the court but yet again refused. I also funded Barr.Ehiedu’s engagement of the Ministry of Justice, Asaba, Delta State, with the facts for a discharge of the matter by the Attorney-General of Delta State, he refused to return feedback. I received several assurance during court sessions where bail was reviewed without a progression of the trial that the matter had been closed and they were expecting a document from the Ministry of Justice, Asaba, to secure my release until I had to be taken back to the prison on multiple occasions. I got fed up with both Registrar and Barr.Ehiedu who kept giving excuses and complained to them and other parties. Both parties did not give reasons for their continued insults while receiving money and refusing to carry out the instructions both to Barr.Ehiedu as a lawyer and Registrar, Samuel, as a staff of Umunede High Court.</p><p name="f5eb" id="f5eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was informed at my next court date that a Judge was retiring and the court would not sit. The next adjourned date was a Salah holiday. I did not receive a new adjourned date due to claimed that the Judge, Justice Dafe, was attending to Election Tribunal duties outside Delta State. I continually requested the casefile for review with a notice that the Judge is with the casefile. I find it strange that the Judge would travel with a casefile but I do not know how that works but reasonably a court should have the casefile available to provide CTCs(certified true copies) to requesting persons. Registrar, Samuel, notified me he had obtained the CTC from the Judge, Justice Dafe, to make copies available but I’ve indicated that absence of original copies of a casefile is questionable in any matter. If there’s any wrongdoing — I won’t tolerate it. I’m already complaining about Barr.Ehiedu’s refusal to act as instructed in an ongoing trial and the notice that ‘i won” yet a refusal to explain if the case was closed and an acquittal obtained.</p><blockquote name="5e02" id="5e02" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">A particular man, reasonably a lawyer, distracted me after Barr.Ehiedu said “I won”, he drew my attention and sought to have an argument distracting me from observing the Judge, Justice Dafe or being aware if any notice was given to me by the Judge. The man kept insisting I raise a finger if I desire to speak which I find unusual. My response to him was he should respect the calm required in a court and stop the noise making.</strong></blockquote><p name="4640" id="4640" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">I am yet to receive an adjourned date but I’ve engaged new lawyers to review the situation. Secure my release and carry out the entirety of my plan stated on Instagram regarding how and what I’ll do to resolve this matter.</p></div></div></section><section name="5591" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="573e" id="573e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Images &amp; References</p><p name="5c33" id="5c33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://asalawpractice.org/financial-autonomy-delta-state-judiciary-guaranteed-full-autonomy/" data-href="https://asalawpractice.org/financial-autonomy-delta-state-judiciary-guaranteed-full-autonomy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://asalawpractice.org/financial-autonomy-delta-state-judiciary-guaranteed-full-autonomy/</a></p></div></div></section>
