I made efforts towards my release immediately. Agbor police tried to impose an accidental discharge when I was reporting an attack against my premises, I refused. I was transferred to Delta State Police Command Asaba, they tried imposing an accidental discharge which I refused again. They wrote a statement themselves contrary to my verbal notice with Michael Morka, Rachael Igberhi present at the instigation of Barr.Kalikwu. Officer Blessing sent out Rachael Igberhi at some point and retained Michael Morka who brought Barr.Kalikwu , Barr.Kalikwu is related to a group of persons who wrongly may claim they were exposed to an incident at my premises.

He also could not have entered the premises without my knowledge so he may have been wounded during entry, while the robbery and assassination was ongoing with he being a suspect, or as a result of his text message that he was “breaking down&quot; earlier at 12:10 PM on April 19, 2022, the day of the attack at my premises and unlawful detainment at Agbor police area command.</p><blockquote name="3988" id="3988" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The post below details the attack.</blockquote><div name="4f17" id="4f17" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--blockquote"><a href="https://medium.com/@moukaemmanuel/the-attack-murder-allegation-against-mouka-emmanuel-f83cdd87fe09" data-href="https://medium.com/@moukaemmanuel/the-attack-murder-allegation-against-mouka-emmanuel-f83cdd87fe09" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@moukaemmanuel/the-attack-murder-allegation-against-mouka-emmanuel-f83cdd87fe09"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The attack : Murder allegation against Mouka Emmanuel</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The attack on April 19, 2022, at my gated premises is claimed to be an accidental discharge through police…</em>medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/@moukaemmanuel/the-attack-murder-allegation-against-mouka-emmanuel-f83cdd87fe09" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="869226f32a6af0c71ac5083c6d700090" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*rQmi59NsUQAqjyj9oQsHUw.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*rQmi59NsUQAqjyj9oQsHUw.jpeg);"></a></div><h3 name="5d39" id="5d39" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">Agbor Police Area Command, Agbor, Delta State, Nigeria</h3><p name="1962" id="1962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I questioned my detainment, the DPO(Divisional Police Officer) assumed to be in charge of the Agbor Police Area Command ordered my detainment without cause. I asked Police officer Shepard why I was detained and insisted he relieve me and assist in returning to the hospital to receive the account of events from Happy Uboh who was “well, energetic enough to speak and was asking my forgiveness and assistance&quot; prior to visiting the Agbor Police Area Command. He did not arrest me when we discussed about my reason for visiting Agbor police area command, the DPO issued the order that he arrest me. I argued about the arrest and he gave vague explanations. I welcomed visitors and kept arguing about my detention. I refused to give a statement according to their imposition, they requested I state an accidental discharge occurred. They recorded my refusal with their mobile phones. I welcomed Judge Oyinchi, a relative whom i expected to act as my lawyer and secure my bail or contest the detainment but he indicated he was not practicing as a lawyer. Officer Duke visited me at the holding cell, he asked me to calmly engage the situation, that was impossible when I was detained, dehumanized, paraded barefooted by officers claiming they were older and as such I should conform to their abuse. He threatened I’d be transferred to Asaba if I kept arguing about the human rights violations. I kept arguing.</p><p name="08b7" id="08b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I met the DPO for the second time seated outside his office, dark skinned, angry faced. I thanked him for the protection Agbor police has continually offered me and asked him to grant an audience so I can “educate&quot; his cluelessness about who I was or why I came to the police station. He evidently had no idea that I was attacked at my premises, reported these attacks on February 12, 2022, to officers at his command. He refused to grant the audience. I experienced the same exhibition of anger towards me without cause at Asaba when he visited me after I’d been transferred and sought to fight with me while I was in the cell, outrightly threatening to attack me. I spent the night at Agbor police area command.</p><h3 name="9392" id="9392" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Delta State Police Command, Asaba, Nigeria</h3><p name="893c" id="893c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Myself, Police Officer Monday, a dark skinned gentleman who later sexually assaulted me by touching my penis at Asaba, A lady identified as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/odibei.happiness" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/odibei.happiness" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Happiness Odibei (Augustine Happiness Odibei) on Facebook</a>, left Agbor for Asaba in a white bus/van. The lady was indicated to be related to the intruder at my premises whose whereabouts are unknown to me till date. There are conflicting claims about his whereabouts but the claim of death has insufficient evidence, and foul play both from police and persons involved makes it unacceptable. I do not believe Happy Uboh is dead.

I preferred my own doctors and made contacts to have my doctors ready to provide healthcare service to me.
