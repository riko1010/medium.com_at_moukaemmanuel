Samuel claimed Happy Uboh died en-route Asaba and he returned to Agbor. Samuel contradicted his claims at a later date, stating that he left Happy Uboh at FMC Asaba due to concerns about violence from persons related to Happy Uboh. I do not have reason or evidence to suspect Samuel Nmorkah of being involved but our father Michael Morka is involved in the attempt to imprison me.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="df2a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3cae" id="3cae" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Samuel, my brother, knows Agbor. He’s lived in Agbor for a long time and has a business.</p><p name="603d" id="603d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My father informed me that Samuel used his car to transport Happy Uboh to a herbalist doctor then later stated that Samuel transported Happy Uboh to FMC (Federal medical centre) Asaba.</p><p name="7bce" id="7bce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I asked Samuel about his activities on April 19, 2022. He stated that Happy Uboh died on his way to FMC Asaba in my father’s vehicle with him driving. He further stated that he returned to Agbor when Happy Uboh died en-route Asaba.</p><p name="d308" id="d308" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2023, I welcomed Samuel at the Agbor prison and asked about the activities of April 19, 2022, when I doubted a death occurred due to contradicting information and malicious schemes that made it evident I was being framed up for murder. He gave a different account of the events of April 19, 2022. He said that he took Happy Uboh to FMC Asaba, then left when he noticed persons related to Happy Uboh may cause trouble to him. I complained about the contradicting account of events but thanked him for being supportive and kind regardless.</p><blockquote name="f50b" id="f50b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I helped Happy Uboh even though he gained unlawful entry into my premises. My brother, Samuel, and my father also exhibited kindness as evident from their stated help provided to Happy Uboh regardless of contradictions.</blockquote><p name="8ecb" id="8ecb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I received a few medical receipts which Samuel did not deem important so they were destroyed and thrown away. It may be from the pharmacy at Agbor or elsewhere but neither he nor I found them important.</p><p name="fded" id="fded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I informed Samuel of my defense as early as 2022 when I was done with my compilation of facts and evidences. He is aware of my argument that a robbery and assassination attempt that was previously reported to the police, in which suspected persons broke into my property to carry out the act surpasses an accusation of murder.</p><blockquote name="2836" id="2836" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Luckily, when armed persons attacked my premises with “Okafor and Emmanuel, a welder, bearing witness and saving my life&quot;, Samuel, was one of the first persons I invited, I reported the incident to him and sought his advise. He informed me he would enquire about the attackers and their motive. I was expecting feedback before the April 19, 2022, attack occurred.</blockquote><p name="663f" id="663f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing">I’ve asked he support my plans to inform the accusers, police and other persons of the facts to ensure they understand that I’m the victim and have evidence and witnesses to prove it. The accusers, police, and other authorities misinformed or involved in falsification of the incident are requested to withdraw their accusation and drop the wrong charge of murder.</p></div></div></section>
