Signal Jammers, Signal detection equipments and other security equipments were amongst recent items ordered to my new office location at Alihame, Agbor. I find it hard to cease operations from random threats until further orchestrations including the freak attack against my property on April 19, 2022, proved that whoever was determined to terminate my operations would go to great lengths including trying to kill me, framing me up for murder, continued attacks while I was detained and sabotaging my defense process. I acquire and invest in latest technology just like Monday, I planned to acquire radar systems which would put me ahead in security research but I still can’t understand why I would be threatened and targeted just like Monday was.</p><p name="a75e" id="a75e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what I was told about how and why Monday was killed in a freak accident. Monday is a relative who acquired an automatic paint mixer at a place called Sapele where he deals in automobile paint. He is from Agbor and built a property in Agbor. Monday beat all competition after acquiring the paint mixer, other paint dealers could not compete as he had all colours for automobile painting. The notice was that his death was a result of his acquisition of new technology that frustrated the competing paint dealers in Sapele. I felt outraged that I’d be threatened in such form in the 21st century. Monday was killed by cows while visiting Agbor from Sapele. It would be funny if it didn’t involve death. Juju is a means to achieve freak outcomes such as what majority of Nigerians suffer. It is common news in Nigerian media to find freak accidents, deaths and difficult to explain situations. After warnings that I should cease my business operations, Juju was brought to my premises at night. They made their fetish sounds and incantations heard. They tried persuading me to leave the safety of the fenced area of my property to engage them at the newly acquired land which was being fenced. I refused for my safety. Monday was constructing a property at the time of the freak accident that led to his death. If I was not threatened and informed that Monday’s death was no accident but an attack for his innovation by competition or malicious persons, I would have accepted the notice that his death was an accident. I continued my business operations and experienced several armed attacks, food poisoning, freak accidents and eventually the attack on April 19, 2022, when a mysterious and unexplained attack occured at my gated premises which has seen me accused wrongly of murder by police that refused my accounts of what occured. I have put up a defense regardless of the threats and evident involvement of juju in the events.</p><h3 name="5807" id="5807" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Acquisition of land for expansion and death threats from seller.</h3></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="0b2e" id="0b2e" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--h3" style="width: 53.747%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sIUwE0vSQd4NBZE5DOo7sw.jpeg" data-width="1014" data-height="873" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sIUwE0vSQd4NBZE5DOo7sw.jpeg"></figure><figure name="20cc" id="20cc" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 46.253%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aAIrjJ5k5eAFcLyOcnypRw.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="1280" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aAIrjJ5k5eAFcLyOcnypRw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption" style="width: 216.202%; left: -116.202%;">Main premises | Newly acquired land for extension of main premises.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="d351" id="d351" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure">The limited space of my main premises is a security concern.

I had to insist the driver of the vehicle with the passenger who’d lost consciousness take the passenger to the nearest police station. He claimed the passenger boarded his vehicle and lost consciousness en-route and he parked at the isolated location unsure of what to do. It was dangerous and I risked my life insisting he take the passenger to the nearest police station. I brought officers to arrest him when he refused to act as I requested for the passenger’s safety. I was repeatedly attacked after this incident.</p><blockquote name="6860" id="6860" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If the driver was a criminal, I did not stay to find out, the moment the police took charge of the unconscious passenger, I left.</blockquote><p name="0fac" id="0fac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">My relationship with Ghana Police is great. I discovered that criminal entities are not thrilled about being made to do right in protection of the life of others not just in this incident but countless others. The Ghana Immigration Service is not an exception, I supported with investigations into Nigerians that fled while facing deportation at the Nigerian consulate Accra. I advised they approach the issue calmly than with a heightened threat level as the persons fled out of fear rather than criminality. My support saw relief and resolution of the issue.</p><blockquote name="dd9b" id="dd9b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">My residence at Alihame, Agbor, receives police officers and other persons regularly, on February 12, 2022, I invited police officer Duke Amerika when I experienced robberies and assassination attempts.</blockquote><p name="43fb" id="43fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I receive other officers from the police force and SSS on regular basis. Evidently there was a change in relations from most locals who may wrongly suspect I was a police officer when my plan was to join the police force in 2021/2022. I do not know the aversion to police by anyone but when negative persons eventually discovered strong police affiliation, criminal entities already exposed to me may feel worried which I suspect is a reason for a change in relations with the locals when my police contacts started engaging me at my Alihame business premises, the same scene where I was attacked and being wrongly accused of murder.</p><h3 name="18b3" id="18b3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Discharge at premises where nobody was exposed or hurt.</h3><p name="06d7" id="06d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I gave notice to all staff and visitors that entry into the premises uninvited or unescorted was forbidden. The reasons are continued robberies, assasination attempts, food poisoning, attempted electrocution through criminal placement of live wires at a metal door and several freak incidents. A firearm discharge is amongst these incidents.</p><figure name="550e" id="550e" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwBbEzawrqI?feature=oembed" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><figcaption class="imageCaption">Incident where no one got hurt at my premises.

They and myself ran to the location of the incident and discovered a discharge occured. No one was at the location of the discharge. One of the electrical staff took pictures of the discharge and may have given persons that viewed it a wrong impression of the incident. Nigerians are terrible at explaining events that scare them, I published this video to clarify the incident and fact that no one was exposed to the discharge. The relevance of this topic is that one of the persons shown on the video is related to the lawyer, Barr.Kalikwu, who collaborated with police to falsify a statement and Happy Uboh, the person they claim to be dead. I wondered why the lawyer was acting against my interest and trying to imprison me with his actions. I asked who recommended the lawyer and I was informed that one of the persons in the video above recommended him to my family. Ironic ?. The lawyer’s negative actions finally made sense so I presented this video to him and explained the incident when his relative was at my premises but not at the location of the discharge and advised he cease from further wrongdoing. I’ve made the video available to prove my argument true that I would not expose anyone to harm in my premises and that no one was at risk during the time of the discharge.</p><h3 name="5560" id="5560" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conflict between New age solar shop, Happy Uboh, and electrician, Emmanuel, about my premises being burnt down due to electrical faults.</h3><p name="a59f" id="a59f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">New age solar shop staff and the electrical staff had a conflict when Happy Uboh stated that the premises would be burnt due to bad wiring by the electrical staff. The electrical staff argued against his claim and presented verifiable arguments proving that if there was a fire hazard it would be intentionally caused by New age solar shop staff. They had a heated argument involving multiple persons as witnesses. I restricted unescorted activities after these and other events. I found blood trails in private areas of the premises proving a New age solar shop staff had gained entry into unauthorized areas. I increased security measures, continually trusted police to assist and restricted entry into the premises prior to being accused of murder during an attack.</p></div></div></section><section name="a6fb" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="7b0d" id="7b0d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading graf--trailing">Happy Uboh(claimed to be dead), Emmanuel, the electrician(responded to a firearm discharge and may wrongly feel targeted even though he was not there as indicated in the video above), and Barr.Kalikwu(falsified a statement of accident discharge to allow police charge me for murder of Happy Uboh without providing information proving death or presenting witnesses) are related.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="848b" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="09eb" id="09eb" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Barr.Goodluck Kalikwu — falsified a statement of an accidental discharge against his relative Happy Uboh</h3><figure name="7f0b" id="7f0b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_kicpMhJ-3hHvpGKc41zvw.jpeg" data-width="720" data-height="724" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_kicpMhJ-3hHvpGKc41zvw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Barr.Goodluck Kalikwu - image from WhatsApp</figcaption></figure><p name="1aa9" id="1aa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Barr.Goodluck Kalikwu, pictured above is related to Happy Uboh, the New age solar shop staff claimed to be dead(I’ve received insufficient and conflicting information, I’m arguing that no death occured and that I’m the target of repeat attacks which were reported to police). He is also related to Emmanuel, the electrical staff featured in the video depicting a discharge where no one was exposed or hurt. Emmanuel, the electrician, his coworker and myself and others responded to the discharge. Barr.Kalikwu may be acting out of malice if he was informed or convinced that his relative Emmanuel, the electrician, was exposed to a firearm discharge at my premises. The disturbing coincidence that he is also related to Happy Uboh, who is claimed to be dead during the April 19, 2022, attack at same premises is equally unexciting. I gave him a detailed account of all that occured, I never stated and never would I ever state that an accident discharge occured. He decided to collaborate with police to write and falsify a claim of an accidental discharge against his relative Happy Uboh. The false claim is what police used to charge me for murder.</p><h3 name="a605" id="a605" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Falsification of a statement by police officers investigating the incidents.</h3><p name="9c0b" id="9c0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Officers Onyeama and blessing continually communicated with the persons accusing me. They informed me that a withdrawal was expected but I argued that the statement they present was falsified and they were not providing proof that the person they claim to be dead, was dead. They were also refusing to investigate the repeat robberies and assassination attempts against me. I eventually stopped tolerating their friendship because they were not willing to act on my release and protection of my life from the people attacking me.

Barr.Kalikwu and police orchestrated the false claim of an accidental discharge to charge me for murder of his relative Happy Uboh.</p><blockquote name="9441" id="9441" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The police have no witness or evidence to support the accusation so the only way to charge me was falsification of a confession stating an accidental discharge.</blockquote><p name="b972" id="b972" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">I compiled my own statement with evidence independent of the falsification by police and presented it to the police, NHRC and the Chief Judge of Delta state judiciary through the warder In-Charge of Agbor prison.
