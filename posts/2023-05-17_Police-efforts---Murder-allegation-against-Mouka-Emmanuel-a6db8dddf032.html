The question of if I shot someone came up, I reminded officer blessing that from Agbor police command we had this argument, before being transferred to her command, where we also had this argument. I never stated that I shot anyone but rather that I experienced a robbery and assassination, animal attacks and other forms of disturbances before April 19, 2022. I also reminded her that she did not provide sufficient information to prove a death occurred, the supposed autopsy saw her and my nephew running out of the morgue at Agbor general Hospital claiming persons inside were threatening them while I was left in handcuffs in the vehicle, how then would an autopsy report be available?. I would have to request an autopsy which would see exhumation of the person they claim to have buried to verify the identity and cause of death while arguing that I experienced a robbery and assassination which is true and factual. She is aware that I gave a verbal account very different from the statement they present, falsely stating that an accidental discharge occurred. Witnesses were present to attest to the event being a robbery and assassination.</p><h3 name="6114" id="6114" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Officer Onyeama, IPO, Delta State Police Command Asaba</h3><p name="0629" id="0629" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Officer Onyeama from Delta state police command Asaba, has been kind enough as at May 3, 2023, to notify me that he was mounting pressure on the Department of public prosecutions, DPP, of the ministry of Justice to drop the charge.

They are nice. Officer Onyeama and Blessing were notified of the complexity of the situation and I brought lawyers to argue on the statement they curated being false and troublesome. Recently I compiled and published my statements, version 3, and version 3.3, containing facts and photos evidence. Officer Onyeama has responded positively to the facts sent to him which requires that the police do not accuse or suspect me of criminal action while I&#39;m a victim and targeted at my private and gated premises by unknown armed robbers and assassins. His recent efforts are engaging the DPP, an agency that reviews cases affecting the Nigerian state such as murder and other serious crimes to advise their opinion and work with state prosecutors to handle such matters at court. I&#39;m sure that if the Commissioner of Police was involved he would act instantaneously to relieve me of the criminal suspicion and detainment but I&#39;m working with the persons available to me and trusting this is resolved ASAP.</p><p name="c5eb" id="c5eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I informed Officers at Asaba while in their custody of my desire to join the Police force, I&#39;m surprised they still had to be persuaded with indisputable evidence to provide me assistance, this evidence took more than 7 months to collect and document. It was available verbally and witnesses could easily have been called. I called the only witness to attest to my claims that indeed I was attacked and the witness was asked to assist. The witness happens to be a random individual coming to provide professional services at the premises and unlike the suspected persons, has no history of breaking into the premises. The officers did not act on the reason for inviting the witness as they were convinced of the claim of an accidental discharge and preferred attestation of that false claim by the witness I brought to the command myself. The witness stated that he does not feel I would want anyone to die because I provided assistance selflessly. The witness is unaware that I was repeatedly robbed and targeted for assassination which is why I emphasized on calling multiple witnesses at the police.</p><h3 name="05e3" id="05e3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why do the Nigeria police force prefer accidental discharge to actual situations?</h3><p name="c392" id="c392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Laziness. When it is not a criminal action involving the police trying to pin a murder allegation on someone, it is laziness. I am confident of this claim given how they came to the conclusion of an accidental discharge without investigation. Prior to this incident I was continually tailed by vehicles suspected to be some form of law enforcement. I reported the robbery and assassination attempts to Officer Duke Amerika on February 12, 2022. I lost consciousness in front of Agbor Police Area Command, in my vehicle. I do not know what transpired while I lost consciousness but when I recovered I was met with a stage set by the Agbor Police Officers with intent to orchestrate an accidental discharge. I refused to engage a police officer in mufty, rather preferring the counter to avoid another unknown attack. The station had a small desk temporarily added to the counter where a lady sat and attended, similar to the officers attending at the permanent counter.</p><blockquote name="e9d7" id="e9d7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I asked the officers for assistance, they asked me the event and I notified them it was a wounded person asking for assistance which I provided during the robbery and assassination attempt on April 19, 2022, they told me to declare an accidental discharge occurred. I refused.</blockquote><p name="2c4d" id="2c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">She tried to write an accidental discharge which I prevented and asked she write what I’m reporting, that someone was wounded and asked assistance during the event I suffered. Immediately, they started making claims I’d be imprisoned for 10 years for stating the person was wounded rather than an accidental discharge. I don’t know their justification but they orchestrated the events to see me tortured and detained. When I was transferred to Asaba, they would have had to carry out an investigation on what occurred as I refused to give or sign a statement at Agbor police command. They didn’t. This issue is a topic as I write this post, the only difference is availablity of my statement compiled independently and presented to the police. It is unlawful to assume that an accidental discharge occurred without questioning or investigating the incident and circumstances. I’ve asked officer Onyeama and Blessing not to be lazy in vindicating me from the murder accusation that the laziness of Agbor police and Asaba police commands brought about.</p></div></div></section><section name="3cf0" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5938" id="5938" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">References &amp; images</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8f90" id="8f90" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://wchat.space/Police_Onyeama_Asaba" data-href="https://wchat.space/Police_Onyeama_Asaba" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chats with Police Officer Onyeama</a></li></ul></div></div></section>
